            As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a shift to remote learning that has
            affected the workforce in a variety of ways. Some of these include isolation and a lack of team
            coordination as a result of a lack of office socialization, changes to productivity, stress, and even
            how businesses will organize themselves even after COVID. The restrictions caused by
            quarantine may subside, but the way we engage with others in business may not be the same.
